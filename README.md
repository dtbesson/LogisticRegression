# LogisticRegressionCoursework
Some university coursework I completed, designed to practise and increase understanding on logistic regression models. We build logistic regression models, then use statistical testing to determine the important features. Finally, we use these models to calculate key values such as odds and odds ratios.

Please find the given brief in the file coursework_question.pdf, and my completed report in GLMsurvivalanalysisCoursework.pdf. The accompanying R code is given in coursework.R
